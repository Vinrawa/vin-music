# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for an intelligent playlist recommendation system for VinMusic Android app. The system will analyze user's local playlists and listening behavior to generate diverse, multi-artist recommendations that match their taste profile. Unlike the current system which suggests playlists from a single artist, the new system will create mixed playlists with multiple artists across similar genres and complementary styles.

## Glossary

- **Taste_Profile**: A data structure representing user's music preferences including top artists, genres, moods, languages, and acoustic DNA (energy, tempo).
- **Playlist_Analyzer**: Component that scans and analyzes all local playlists to extract music preference patterns.
- **Genre_Detector**: Component that identifies music genres from songs and artists using metadata inference and keyword matching.
- **Recommendation_Engine**: Core system that generates diverse playlist recommendations based on user's taste profile.
- **Artist_Diversity_Filter**: Component that prevents same-artist repetition by limiting consecutive songs from the same artist.
- **Mixed_Playlist**: A recommended playlist containing songs from multiple artists (minimum 3 different artists).
- **InnerTube_API**: YouTube Music API interface used for fetching music metadata and recommendations.
- **Local_Playlist**: User-created playlists stored in Room database (PlaylistEntity and PlaylistSongEntity).
- **Interaction_Signal**: User behavior data including play count, skip count, likes, downloads, and repeat count.
