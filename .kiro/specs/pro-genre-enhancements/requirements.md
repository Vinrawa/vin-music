# Requirements Document: Pro Genre Enhancements

## Introduction

This enhancement elevates the user experience by providing differentiated, memorable interactions for each music category while maintaining the app's existing architecture using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and YouTube Music API via InnerTube.
